The application does not require any registration or user data, is optimized for any device, does not contain ads, and is completely free.
<br>
The language of the application: Ukrainian.
***
## Instructions:

1. On the main screen, you can launch the application by selecting the Ukrainian language. The button for the Russian language will move away from you. You can also read these instructions on the main screen.
In the mobile version of the application, instead of selecting the language, there is a button that says "Почати" (Start).<br>
